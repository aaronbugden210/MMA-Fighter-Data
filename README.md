# MMA-Fighter-Data
A personal project for cleaning data and for creating dashboards.
I enjoy watching a bit of MMA and in my free time I train in boxing, so I figured it'd be fun to look at some fighter data.
What I didn't expect was how incomplete and unclean this data was.
I took this project as a chance to better learn how to clean and prepare data for visualization and for a pivot table with a dashboard.
I took it upon myself to setup an age group category, with any fighter missing an age being classified as 'Not Found'.
Any fighter that fought under an association that was not listed was identified as such in that respective column.
If a fighter's weight class was not written down either, it was replaced with 'Unknown', same for the country the fighter represented.
There was a substantial amount of missing data in the set and what I filled in was largely what I considered to be the most important data that I wanted to represent.
I wasn't too concerned with birth dates for this particular project, tho in the future it may be fun to go back and set up the dashboard to represent year of birth.
For the dashboard, I also enjoyed playing around with creating custom slicers. It's a skill I'd like to work on more and this project was a good
  one for me to dip my toes into that aspect of excel. It got me to play around with Custom Lists for the slicer orders as well.
